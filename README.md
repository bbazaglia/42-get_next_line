# 42-get_next_line
This project is designed to return each line read from a file descriptor. 

On the top of the main file (get_next_line.c) I added some necessary concepts to understand the development of the project.

Disclaimer: The main purpose of this repository is to expose my codes and help other students to understand what was done in each function. Therefore, this work should be used for academic reasons, by those who aim to learn, and not merely copy.
